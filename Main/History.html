                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span class="style_1">Starting off<br /></span><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">It all started halfway through 2010, I think I was twelve or thirteen. I must have been reading something on the internet about programing or maybe I was bored. At the time I was aiming for an iPhone app. I remember immediately going to the Apple developer page and signing up. I then downloaded Xcode and all that good stuff and got my first program up and running, it was the famous “Hello World!”, I did this with the help of TheNewBoston’s Objective-C programing tutorials.<br />The want to make games excited me so I partially printed out a copy Apple’s get to know Objective-C documentation. I took it to school the next day and remember reading it in my English lesson instead of probably some tedious task. From what I can remember it was a little overwhelming as it was targeted at people who knew all about programing beforehand, this booklet thing spend a few months in my locker.<br />A few days later, after I had written a few more simple programs like “enter a number then add it to another”, I approached a friend, we shall call him George, with the idea of game development. George was enthusiastic about the idea and the two of us talked about the subject for a few days. Naturally our goals were high, we knew almost nothing about programing and we were already dreaming up games that I can’t even make now! Our first(good) game idea was a RC racer where you drive around a little car in a 3D world. After a day or two we both agreed that this would be much to difficult and decided to learn the language first.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">I think by this time I ditched the youtube tutorials in favor for a book “Objective-C for dummies” I followed along quite happily for a chapter or two but I soon got overwhelmed and stopped reading the book, in fact I still haven’t finished it.<br />I then moved back to the youtube tutorials, but I remember not actually following them because I just wanted to finish the tutorials and actually make something resembling a game, this was because as a beginner you have no idea how the basics they teach you actually apply to a game and I was frustrated about that. I then moved onto iPhone app tutorials and making two of them but because I wasn’t paying much attention to the base Objective-C tutorials I got lost quick.<br />During one weekend I called George up on Skype and asked his progress on programming, he told me that he had basically given up because it was too hard, I don’t remember much else from here but I believe that I soon gave up too. <br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span class="style_1">The Break<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">I did try to write some programs in the time between what I call the reboot and when I “gave up”, I did make some very simple stuff like a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle with a entered radius and I did manage to make a working GUI for the iPhone. Incidentally this was when really got into Minecraft.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2"><br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span class="style_1">The Reboot<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">I properly got back into programming when I got the Arduino Uno fun kit thing from Sparkfun in early August of 2011. The Arduino is a open source micro-controller board which basically means that you can interact with sensors, servos and stuff like that to make a working thing. The Arduino environment ran on what I believe to be a library on top of C++, having worked with Objective-C I saw familiarities and felt at home. I managed to make a few cool things with the Arduino like a Programmable combination lock and a little car that drove itself around while avoiding hitting walls. When I wanted to interface the Wii classic controller with the Arduino I came across a demo which used a IDE called Processing to visually graph data from the Arduino. I downloaded it and with a little research I discovered it was java based with a library on top. This library made it very easy to display items on screen and I used what I had learnt to make a game! finally, after a year since I was first introduced to programming WongPong was born. Being my first game the code was an absolute mess, it was completely procedural but it would have been much easier if I had know about objects. WongPong took me about a week to make, it was in the holidays so half of it was dedicated to making it. Anyway it didn’t get much attention, a few people played it and I that was fine with me. When I finished WongPong I felt like I had accomplished something worthwhile and was proud of myself and soon after I realised I had the “Programming Bug”.<br />I continued to experiment with Processing making a few half finished games and then I saw Notch’s 48 hour Ludum Dare Stream where he made a game in 48 hours for a competition, I was amazed to say the least. Notch has always been kind of a inspiration to me and after the stream, even more. So since I was already working with baby java and wanted to release things on both windows and OSX it was logical to follow in Notch’s footsteps.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">I remember when I first moved to proper Java, things confused me like Static or public but after watching some of TheNewBoston’s Java tutorials this soon became child’s play. <br />It was now around October 2011 and I was still hesitant to move from Objective-C to Java as my main language and during a trip to sydney I bought two books “Java all in one for dummies” and “Programming in Objective-C” I read the Java book first and to this day I haven’t touched the Objective-C book.<br /></span></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style_2"><span style="line-height: 22px; " class="style_2">My second game was written only using Java, it was a text based adventure game. It didn’t get much attention at all, because it was only text and people are obsessed with graphics these days.<br />The following two games are written with a 2D graphics library on top of Java. Something weird that I have not planed at all is that every one on my games has been released near a school holiday.</span><span class="style_3"><br /></span><span style="line-height: 17px; " class="style_4">You can find detailed information about each game on their own page.</span><span class="style_3"><br /></span></p>
